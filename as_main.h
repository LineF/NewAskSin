 * in the eeprom, to providing interfaces for user modules that implement
 * actual device logic.
 *
 * This is a very simple, non-working example of the basic API used in the main
 * routines:
 * @include docs/snippets/basic-AS.cpp
 *
 * All send functions are used by sensor or actor classes like THSensor or Dimmer.
